**Book: The Martian - Andy Weir (238/332 - 72% complete)**

Mark lost communication with Earth when he broke a circuit while drilling holes. Now he's all alone making preparations for the hike to Schiaparelli crater. Kind of a lull right now but expecting the action to pick up nearing the end of the book.
