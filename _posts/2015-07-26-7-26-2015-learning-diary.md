**Website: [Future Timeline](http://www.futuretimeline.net/)**

This is a very cool website I stumbled upon that takes a look into future events. The predictions there are pretty wild but I believe all of them are backed what's going on in today's world. It's amazing how we've advanced so far in the 21st century. It makes me wonder what life is going to be like in 2030 or 2050. The way technology has been progressing, it's probably a completely different lifestyle from what it is today. Crazy to think about.

I haven't read The Martian today but will do so later tonight or tomorrow. Kind of spent the day pondering about college which is only about a month away! Ugh...

**Book: The Martian - Andy Weir (238/332 - 72% complete)**

Mark lost communication with Earth when he broke a circuit while drilling holes. Now he's all alone making preparations for the hike to Schiaparelli crater. Kind of a lull right now but expecting the action to pick up nearing the end of the book.
