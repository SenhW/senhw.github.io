## 8/9

**Book: Head First Design Patterns (93/681 - 13% complete)**

Going through the chapter on the Observer Pattern.

**Video: [Masculinity vs Femininity - The Male & Female Mind Fully Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmeDDN1_TSQ)**

Very interesting video on how men and women think differently from each other. Males are mostly geared toward processing thoughts objectively, trying to fix problems and be proactive about them, while females usually think based on their emotions, creativity and how they are better at speaking languages. It goes into a lot of detail that I forgot but this really opened up my mind and I'll have to rewatch it again and pay more attention. All of the Actualized.org videos are so good and life changing. Hopefully I can go through and absorb all the info.
