**Article: [Why Iâ€™m Upgrading to Windows 10](http://reviews.gizmodo.com/why-i-m-upgrading-to-windows-10-1719559557) - Gizmodo**

I've been considering upgrading my laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 but I am hesitant since Windows 7 works beautifully for me and I feel there's no point of trying to move to Windows 10. Windows 10 is going to have an entirely new interface so I'm going to have to spend energy learning how to navigate the OS. This could be more pain than worth it. Though luckily the free upgrade lasts a year so there's plenty of time to decide. I've always been a late adapter and I don't mind not having the newest toys. I'll see what others say about Windows 10 before I make a final decision whether I switch over to the dark side from my beloved Windows 7 operating system.

**Book: The Martian - Andy Weir (111/332 - 33% complete)**

Getting a good feeling that Mark Watney will be saved. Given the circumstances he's in, he is so mentally strong and wise in using the obsolete Pathfinder to communicate back to Earth. I hope I can have the attitude of Mark Watney. Even when there is no one around to guide him, he keeps on fighting for his life and has hope he can survive no matter the odds he's facing.
