Earned $14.50 online today while watching two doomsday documentaries: [A Comet Strikes the Earth & Causes Major Devastation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J08PuCQChU4) and [Could An Asteroid Impact Event Cause Mass Extinction on Earth ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwJL25xVG8). Fun.

Also digging the YouTube's video player update. The progress panel looks very sleek! They did a great job.
